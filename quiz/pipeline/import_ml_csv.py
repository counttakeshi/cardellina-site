"""Import a Macaulay URL harvest (CSV) into the quiz's photo bank.

The harvester that produces the CSV is a separate tool - it collects asset ids
and credits, never image files. This script folds its output into
data/raw/photos_ml.json, which is the same cache fetch_photos.py writes, so the
existing packer and the app pick it up with no further changes.

Two things it fixes on the way in.

**The rating skew.** The harvester asks for exactly as many photographs as it
wants and takes them in rank order, so a run of 50 is the 50 best-rated: 87% of
the CSV sits at 4.5 stars or above. Those are the perched adult in golden hour,
which is the one bird nobody has trouble identifying. This samples across
rating bands instead of taking the top, so the quiz sees ordinary photographs
too. Sampling cannot invent spread that is not in the file - for that the
harvester needs to ask for a much larger pool than it keeps - but it stops the
bank being sorted best-first.

**The Mexican share.** The CSV's `region` column is empty, but `location` holds
a stringified dict with the country code in it, so the flag can be recovered
from there rather than lost.
