# Wait for Macaulay's rate limit to lift, then harvest.
#
# The harvest itself is a heavy process - it holds every species' photographs in
# memory - and this machine kills the biggest expendable thing whenever it runs
# short of RAM. Having that process do the waiting meant it was killed mid-sleep
# over and over. So the waiting is done here instead, by a shell loop and a
# single curl, and the heavy work only starts once there is work to do.
#
# One probe every ten minutes is six an hour, which cannot plausibly be the
# thing the rate limit exists to stop.
