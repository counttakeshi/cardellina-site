Rosalía's divorce from her former husband in 1861 perhaps gives a clue. The coincidence of Rosita's name and Sumichrast's discovery of this rose-coloured bunting is beautifully apt. It appears it was his colleague, George Newbold Lawrence, who decided on the name after receiving specimens from Sumichrast in New York, 1872. At the time Lawrence noted that the bird was as beautiful, if not more, than the Orange-breasted Bunting and Painted Bunting both found nearby. Rosita herself was a mystery for well over a century, listed in the reference works as nothing more than a first name. She was finally identified in 2016 by José Alberto Lobato García, a Mexican birder and biology student, who traced her through Oaxacan records and eventually contacted a living member of the Nivón family for confirmation.
